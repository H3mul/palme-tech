> [!IMPORTANT]  
> QLC looks for things like fixtures in the QLC+ [system and user](https://www.qlcplus.org/old/docs/html_en_EN/questionsandanswers.html#user-folder) dirs.
> In Windows, these are `C:\Users\MyUser\QLC+` and `C:\QLC+`. In order for everything to work smoothly, its suggested to symlink this repo dir to one of those locations, eg:
>
> ```
> mklink /J "C:\Users\MyUser\QLC+" "<repo dir location>\qlc"
> ```
